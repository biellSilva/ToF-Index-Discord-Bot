# Tower of Fantasy Info Unofficial Discord Bot


Initially created by [biellSilva](https://github.com/biellSilva), with the intention of making it easier for Discord users to search for [Tower of Fantasy](https://www.toweroffantasy-global.com) in-game information 

Special thanks to [toweroffantasy.info](https://toweroffantasy.info) who accepted my request to be able to use site data to build the bot and to everyone who contributed with ideas and encountered problems during the time using it.
